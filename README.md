### E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
The project's main goal was to reduce customer churn rates by analyzing customer behavior and identifying the reasons behind it. We understood that acquiring new customers is typically more expensive than retaining existing ones, so we wanted to offer a solution that would enable businesses to offer suitable incentives to keep their customers. One of the biggest challenges we identified was the lack of analytics tools available to traders in Saudi Arabia's e-commerce market. Therefore, we set out to create a tool that could help these businesses analyze customer behavior, which could, in turn, help them retain more customers and avoid closing their stores. Overall, I am proud of the knowledge sharing and teamwork that took place during the project, which improved our skills and helped us overcome challenges together.
